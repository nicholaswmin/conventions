- [Keep it simple][kiss]. Anything else, [you don't need it][yagni].  
- The runtime, source code & Github defaults are the *only* 1st-class citizens.       
  Any 3rd-party modules, services & conventions are *undesirable* dependencies.
- A robust & well-defined test suite is more valuable than the source code.

## Publishing

> *must* be created as a [Github Release][gh-relea] & follow [Semver][semver]:

> example: publishing a new release:

```bash
gh release create 1.7.1
```

> note: *must not* include a `v` prefix 

List current releases:

```bash
gh release list
```  

## Branching

> *must* follow [Github Flow][ghb-flow]:

1. Create a branch.  
   Use a concise name, i.e: `increase-test-timeout`.
2. Push code changes to the branch.  
   Commit messages *must* follow [conventions](#commit-messages).
4. Create a pull request.
5. Address review comments.
6. When approved, merge the PR & delete the branch.

> **note:** `default`/`main` branch *must* always
> exist in a working & deployable state.

## Commit messages
 
> *must* follow [Conventional Commits][cc-about], a convention dovetailing 
> with Semver.   

It prescribes the following format:

```bash
<type>: <description>
```

where:

- `<type>`: any of: `fix` or `feat` or [specific others][cc-specs].
- `<description>`: a short summary of code changes.

Commits with breaking changes *must* append `!` after `<type>`:

```bash
<type>!: <description>
```

### Examples

#### Non-breaking changes

```bash
# Good:
git commit -m"fix: array parsing issue with multiple spaces"

# Bad:
# "fixed" is invalid, use "feat" or "fix" postfixed with ":"
git commit -m"fixed array parsing issue with multiple spaces"

# Bad:
# missing a space between `<type>:` and `<description>`
git commit -m"fix: array parsing issue with multiple spaces"
```

#### Breaking changes

```bash
# Good:
git commit -m"feat!: mark 'name' as required parameter"

# Bad:
# "!" must come before ":", not after.
git commit -m"feat:! mark 'name' as required parameter"
```
