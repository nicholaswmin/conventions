# @TODO
# write a powershell script that:
# - opens file .netrc (or win equivalent)
# - finds the linenumber containing a string "api.github.com"
# - echoes that line + 2 subsequent lines (only)
# 
# - accepts an NRC_PATH env. var which contains the file path to .netrc
#   - sanitises the parameter against malicious input
