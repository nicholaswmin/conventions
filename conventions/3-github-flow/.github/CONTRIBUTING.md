## Branching

> follows [Github Flow][ghb-flow], a lightweight branching model.

1. Create a branch.  
   Use a concise name, i.e: `increase-test-timeout`.
2. Push code changes to the branch.  
   Commit messages *must* follow [conventions](#commit-messages).
4. Create a pull request.
5. Address review comments.
6. When approved, merge the PR & delete the branch.

> **note:** `default`/`main` branch *must* always
> exist in a working & deployable state.
